Template: ssmtp/overwriteconfig
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Automatically overwrite config files?
 The mail configuration file /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf can be automatically
 updated on each upgrade with the information supplied to the debconf
 database. If you do not want this to happen (ie/ you want to maintain
 control of this file yourself) then set this option to have the program
 never touch this file.

Template: ssmtp/root
Type: string
Default: postmaster
_Description: Username who gets mail for userids < 1000:
 Mail sent to a local user whose UID is less than 1000 will instead be
 sent here. This is useful for daemons which mail reports to root and
 other system UIDs.
 Make this empty to disable rewriting.

Template: ssmtp/mailhub
Type: string
Default: mail
_Description: Name of your mailhub:
 This sets the host to which mail is delivered. The actual machine
 name is required; no MX records are consulted. Commonly, mailhosts
 are named "mail.domain.com".

Template: ssmtp/port
Type: string
Default: 25
_Description: Remote SMTP port number:
 If your remote SMTP server listens on a port other than 25 (Standard/RFC)
 then set it here.

Template: ssmtp/rewritedomain
Type: string
_Description: Domain to masquerade as:
 ssmtp will use "username@REWRITEDOMAIN" as the default From: address
 for outgoing mail which contains only a local username.

Template: ssmtp/mailname
Type: string
_Description: Name to store in /etc/mailname:
 This is the portion of the address after the '@' sign to be shown on
 outgoing news and mail messages.

Template: ssmtp/hostname
Type: string
_Description: Fully qualified hostname:
 This should specify the real hostname of this machine, and will be
 sent to the mailhub when delivering mail.

Template: ssmtp/fromoverride
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Allow override of From: line in email header?
 A "positive" response will permit local users to enter any From: line
 in their messages without it being mangled, and cause ssmtp to rewrite
 the envelope header with that address. A "negative" response will
 disallow this, and use only the default address or addresses set in
 /etc/ssmtp/revaliases.
